/**
 * ComputationAction2 will print the result of the compuration made by 
 * children elements but only if the computation itself is named, that is if the
 * name attribute of the associated computation element is not null. In other
 * words, anonymous computations will not print their result.
 * 
 * ComputationAction2 differs from ComputationAction1 in its handling of
 * instance variables. ComputationAction1 has a simple <Code>nameStr</code>
 * instance variable. This variable is set when the begin() method is called 
 * and then later used within the end() method. 
 * 
 * This simple approach works properly if the begin() and end()
 * method of a given action are expected to be called in sequence. However,
 * there are situations where the begin() method of the same action instance is 
 * invoked multiple times before the matching end() method is invoked. 
 * 
 * When this happens, the second call to begin() overwrites values set by
 * the first invocation to begin(). The solution is to save parameter values 
 * into a separate stack. The well-formedness of XML will guarantee that a value
 * saved by one begin() will be consumed only by the matching end() method.
 * 
 * Note that in the vast majority of cases there is no need to resort to a 
 * separate stack for each variable. The situation of successive begin() 
 * invocations can only occur if: 
 * 
 * 1) the associated pattern contains a wildcard, i.e. the &#42; character
 * 
 * and
 * 
 * 2) the associated element tag can contain itself as a child 
 *  
 * For example, "&#42;/computation" pattern means that computations can contain
 * other computation elements as children.
