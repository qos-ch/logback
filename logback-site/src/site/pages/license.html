    <p>As of release 0.9.18, logback source code and binaries are
    dual-licensed under the EPL v1.0 and the LGPL 2.1, or more
    formally:</p>

    <p class="source">Logback: the reliable, generic, fast and flexible logging framework.
Copyright (C) 1999-2017, QOS.ch. All rights reserved. 

This program and the accompanying materials are dual-licensed under
either the terms of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License v1.0</a> as published by

    <!-- =========================================== -->
    
    <p>The EPL/LGPL dual-license serves several purposes. The LGPL
    license ensures <em>continuity</em> in terms of licensing of the
    logback project. Prior to version 0.9.18, logback was licensed
    (exclusively) under the LGPL v2.1.  Moreover, since the EPL is
    deemed <a
    href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_htm">incompatible</a>
    by the Free Software Foundation, the LGPL will allow various
    licensees, in particular software distributors who may be already
    bound by the terms of the GPL or the LGPL, to distribute our
    software.
    </p>

    <p>On the other hand, the EPL license will placate organizations
    which refuse certain restrictions imposed by the LGPL.
    </p>
    
    <p>Please note that logback-classic is intended to be used behind
    the SLF4J API, which is licensed under the <a
    href="http://www.slf4j.org/license.html">MIT license</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If you wish to make a significant contribution to the logback
    project, you are invited to file a <a href="cla.txt">Contributor
    License Agreement</a>. The purpose of this agreement is to
    formalize the terms of your contribution and to protect the
    project in case of litigation.
    </p>

    <p>Upon request, we may exempt open-source projects from LGPL and
    EPL's reciprocity clauses so that the said projects can develop
    logback extensions under the license of their choice. Exemptions
    are granted on a case by case basis.</p>
