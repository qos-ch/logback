    <h2>Logback Console Plugin for Eclipse</h2>
    
    <p>During the development process, it is common for developers to
    print log output on the console. Typically, the developer will
    also customize the format of the log output by setting properties
    of a <code>PatternLayout</code> instance.  The Logback Console
    Plugin for Eclipse serves the same purpose as the regular console,
    but offers several advantages over the plain-old console. Below is
    a list of key advantages of our plugin:
    </p>
    
    <ul>

      <li>Event of level WARN and ERROR are colored in orange and
      respectively in red.</li>

      <li>Go to the java class and line where any given logging request was
      issued by double-clicking on its output line.
      </li>

      <li>Filter events with logback's powerful filtering mechanism
      without changing your logging configuration.
      </li>
    
      <li>Change the output format dynamically whenever you chose to do so.</li>


      <li>Easy configuration (only one line in your <em>logback.xml</em> file).
      </li>
     
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    
    <p>
     Installing the plugin requires a few steps. First get the plugin from
     our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Once the transfer is complete, unzip the file called
     <code>ch.qos.logback.eclipse_<em>VERSION</em>.zip</code>. Place the folder
     found inside the archive in the following directory: <em>ECLIPSE_INSTALL/plugins/</em>
     where <em>ECLIPSE_INSTALL</em> is the directory where you've installed Eclipse.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Relaunching Eclipse should load the plugin. To access the logback plugin, open
     the following menu: <em>Window &gt; Show view &gt; Other... </em>. You should see
     the <em>Logback View</em> nested in the <em>Logback</em> category. Selecting the
     view will add it to your workspace.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Logging to the logback plugin</h3>
    
    <p>
     Logging to the logback plugin takes a single line of configuration
     in your <em>logback.xml</em> configuration file, as you can see below.
    </p>
    
    <div class="source"><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;

  &lt;consolePlugin /&gt;
  
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre></div>
  
   <p>
    This element will trigger the creation of a <code>SocketAppender</code> that will send
    events to the localhost, on port <em>4321</em> by default. That's all it takes to run your
    software and log to the logback plugin. By default, logging events are not filtered, but please
    keep in mind that context-wide filtering in your logging configuration may affect the events
    that are received by the logback plugin.
   </p>
    
   <p>If you already have
    a server running on the default port, you can specify the port that will be used
    by adding a simple attribute to the xml element:
   </p>
    
    <div class="source"><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;

  &lt;consolePlugin port="4567" /&gt;
  
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre></div>    
    
   <p>
    In that case, however, you will need to specify in the plugin preferences on which
    port to listen for events. The plugin preferences will be covered in a following section
    of this document.
   </p>
   
   <h3>Using the logback plugin</h3>
   
   <p>
    Once the <em>Logback View</em> is shown on your workspace, you might want to
    configure it to fit your needs. Look at the right side of the plugin view.
    You should see two buttons, along with the usual three Eclipse icons:
   </p>
   
   <img src="images/plugin/buttons.gif" alt="buttons.gif"/>
   
   <p>
    The first button on the left clears the console. The second button toggles
    the auto-scroll functionality. When enabled, you will always see the latest
    logs that have been received by the plugin. If you disable the auto scrolling,
    the view will display the current logs, and add the new ones at the bottom of
    the list.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The third button opens a sub-menu that lets you configure the logback plugin. This
    will be covered in a short moment.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    When your software logs events, they are displayed in the logback view as shown
    below:
   </p>
   
   <img src="images/plugin/sampleLogs.gif" alt="sampleLogs.gif"/>
   
   <p>
    All events with the <em>WARN</em> level are displayed in orange. <em>ERROR</em>
    level events are displayed in red.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Double-clicking on a log entry will open a Java editor and show you the line
    where the entry was requested. It is an easy way to directly access
    the class and method that logged the selected entry.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    When an icon is shown on the left of the logging event, it means that the
    logging event contains a stacktrace. Right-clicking on the line reveals
    a sub-menu that lets you open Eclipse's StackTrace Console and display the
    stacktrace. You can click on the underlined parts of the stacktrace to open
    an editor revealing the selected class.
   </p>
   
   <img src="images/plugin/stackTrace.gif" alt="stackTrace.gif"/>
   
   <h3>Configuring the logback plugin</h3>
   
   <p>
    On the right of the view, right next to the auto-scroll toggle is
    a button that opens a sub menu.
   </p>
   
   <h4>Preferences</h4>
   
   <p>
    The first item in this menu opens the plugin's preference window.
   </p>
   
   <img src="images/plugin/prefs.gif" alt="prefs.gif" />
   
   <p>
    In this window, you can configure the pattern that will be used by the plugin
    to display the logs. By default, it is configured to show the following informations:
   </p>

   <ul>
    <li>
     Relative time since launch
    </li>
    <li>
     Level of the request
    </li>
    <li>
     The thread name
    </li>
    <li>
     Name of the logger. The name is automatically shortened when longer than
     25 characters
    </li>
    <li>
     The message of the request
    </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>An important point about this pattern is that, if it is
   modified, the changes are immediately reflected on the
   <strong>current content</strong> of the logback view.  That means
   that if you would like to display an <code>MDC</code> value, or any
   other information that the <code>PatternLayout</code> provides, you
   can change it even <em>after</em> the logs have been requested.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Along with the pattern, you can specify the port on which the plugin will listen
    for logging events. You can also choose the font type and size that will be used
    to display the logs in the logback view.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Finally, you can choose how many logging events should be displayed in the
    view before the list is trimmed. By default, the logback plugin will display
    20'000 events. Once this number is reached, the plugin automatically drops
    the 30% oldest logs. Please note that changing this value to a too much higher
    value might lead to memory issues, or even crash Eclipse.
   </p>
   
   
   <h4>Filters</h4>
   
   <p>
    The logback plugin lets you filter logging events when they are
    received. It uses the powerful <code>EvaluatorFilter</code> objects
    that are available in logback. For detailed information about these filters, you might want
    to check the <a href="manual/filters.html">corresponding documentation</a> 
    in the logback manual. In this document, we will only
    cover some basic points, enough to get you started using the filtering
    functionality of the logback plugin.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The second item of the sub-menu on the right of the logback view
    opens the filter configuration window:
   </p>

   <img src="images/plugin/filterWindow.gif" alt="filterWindow.gif"/>
   
   <p>
    The upper part of the window lists the filters that are currently
    used by the logback plugin. The lower part lets you create, edit
    or delete a filter.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    A filter is composed of three pieces of information. First, a Java expression,
    that will be evaluated for each logging event that is received by
    the logback plugin. This expression can use a set of common variables
    such as <code>level</code>, <code>logger</code>, <code>message</code>, 
    and several others. For a complete list of available variables, please
    refer to the <a href="manual/filters#EventEvaluator.html">chapter 
    about filters</a> in the logback manual.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The second and third pieces of information that compose a filter are the
    actions that will be taken depending on the result of the evaluation, for
    a filter match and a filter mismatch.
    Three actions are possible: <em>ACCEPT</em>, <em>DENY</em>
    or <em>NEUTRAL</em>. Setting a filter's reply to <em>ACCEPT</em>
    or <em>DENY</em> will prevent the plugin from evaluating any
    other filter and return a definitive result on the logging event.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Let us create a filter that will drop any request that has a level
    lower than <em>INFO</em>. A click on the <em>New</em> button creates
    a new filter. Enter the following informations in the corresponding
    fields:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     Expression: <code>level &gt;= INFO</code>
    </li>
    <li>
     Action on filter match: <code>NEUTRAL</code>
    </li>
    <li>
     Action on filter mismatch: <code>DENY</code>
    </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>
    Here is what the window should look like, once you've
    saved the filter.
   </p>
 
   <img src="images/plugin/createFilter.gif" alt="createFilter.gif" />
   
   <p>
    We've just created a filter that will drop any requests whose
    level is lower than <em>INFO</em>. Note the use of the <em>NEUTRAL</em>
    value as the action to be taken when the filter is matched. Since
    we do not know what other filters might want to do, there is no reason
    to stop evaluating when the level is higher or equal to <em>INFO</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    You may have noticed the two buttons on the left side of the filter windows
    labelled <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em>. An important concept ruling the filters
    in logback is that filters are called in a chain. As we've seen above, 
    a filter returning <em>ACCEPT</em> or <em>DENY</em> will stop the chain
    and have a direct impact on the logging event. It is sometimes important
    to manage the order in which filters are called to achieve a specific
    filtering policy.
   </p>
