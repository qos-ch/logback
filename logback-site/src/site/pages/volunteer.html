    <h2>Call for volunteers</h2>

    <p>We are looking for volunteers in the following areas (in order
    of decreasing priority).</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>logback in 10 minutes</b> 
      
      <p>We are looking for a volunteer to write a short document
      describing logback for beginners, entitled say "logback in 10
      minutes". This document is likely to be the most widely read
      document on the site. Writing such a document is an excellent
      opportunity to learn logback. Obviously, there would editorial
      help and guidance coming from the logback developers.  </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Write a tool for parsing log files</b>

      <p>We are looking for a volunteer to write a tool for parsing
      log files.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Improve OSGi support</b>
      
      <p>We are looking for an OSGi expert to improve OSGi support in
      logback.  </p></li>
      
      <li><b>Fixing bugs</b>

      <p>We are looking for volunteers for fixing logback
      bugs. Volunteering to solve bugs is a good way to learn about
      any project.
      </p>      
      </li>

      <li><b>Proof reading the documentation</b>
      <p>We are always looking for volunteers to proof-read the
      documentation. Suggestions as to the design as well as
      look-and-feel of the site are also welcome.</p>
