    <h2>Before you report a bug</h2>

    <p>The logback community consists of those who use logback and its
    modules, help answer questions on discussions lists, contribute
    documentation and patches, and those who develop and maintain its
    code. Those who assist on a day to day basis resolving
    bug reports do this for a wide variety of reasons, and almost all
    of them do this on their own time.</p>

    <p>Many bugs reported end up not being a bug in logback, but are
    due to misconfiguration, problems caused by installed
    applications, the operating system, etc.
    </p>

    <p>Before reporting a bug please make every effort to resolve the
    problem yourself.  Just reporting a bug will not fix it. A good
    bug report includes a detailed description of the problem and a
    succinct test case which can reproduce the problem.
    </p>

    <h3>Review the documentation</h3>
    
    <p>Review the documentation for the version of component you are
    using.  The problem you are having may already be addressed in the
    docs.
    </p>

    <h3>Search the mailing list archives</h3>
    
    <p>It is very likely you are not the first to run into a problem.
    Others may have already found a solution.  Our various mailing lists
    are likely to have discussed this problem before.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Search JIRA</h3>
    
    <p>Please search the bug database to see if the bug you are seeing
    has already been reported.  The bug may have already been fixed
    and is available in a later version.  If someone else has reported
    the same bug, you could add supporting information to help
    reproduce and resolve the bug.

    <h3>Reporting a bug</h3>
    
    <p>Only after you have exhausted the aforementioned steps, should
    you file a formal report in JIRA, our bug tracking system.
    </p>

    <p>Please make sure you provide as much information as possible.
    It is hard to fix a bug if the person looking into the problem
    cannot reproduce it.
