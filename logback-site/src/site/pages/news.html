  <h3>XXth of September 2008 - Release of version 0.9.10</h3>

  <p>In case of errors during initialization, logback-classic now
  <em>automatically</em> prints out its internal status. This has been
  a frequently requested feature.
  </p>

  <p>The LogbackValve in logback-access (ensuring integration with
  Tomcat), will now systematically print its internal status upon
  initialization, unless told to be quiet. This greatly helps
  troubleshooting the configration of logback-access under Tomcat.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=147">bug
  147</a> which occured when the user inadvertently attempted to set
  the layout of a <code>SyslogAppender</code>.  The code now actively
  prevents this. Documenation has been updated to reflect the change.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-56">bug
  LBCLASSIC-56c</a> originally reported by Michel Colette. Backslash
  characters are now correctly interpreted in filename patterns.
  </p>

  <p>The TurboFilterChain in a LoggerContext is <a
  href="http://svn.qos.ch/viewvc?view=rev&amp;revision=1678">now
  cleared</a> when the shutdownAndReset method is called. This problem
  was reported on May 1st, 2008, by Julia Hu on the logback
  developpers list.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-48">LBCORE-48</a>.  During
  rollover, compression of large files would bring all logging to a
  halt. In this latest release, the rolled over file is first renamed,
  which is a relatively fast operation, and only then is the renamed
  file compressed asyncronously (in a separate thread).
  </p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-11">LBCORE-11</a>.  It is now
  possible to instruct TimeBasedRollingPolicy to delete old files,
  thus controlling then number of archived log files.</p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-42">LBCORE-42</a>. If the
  parent directory of the log file does not exist, then FileAppender
  will create it, including any necessary but nonexistent parent
  directories. 
  </p>



  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-27">LBCORE-27</a> reported by
  Peter Royal. SMTPAppender now outputs its presentation footer and
  file footer in the the correct order.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-67">LBCLASSIC-67</a>
  reported by Alessandro Fustini. SMTPAppender now correctly
  configures the layout used to format the subject line of the
  outgoing email. It no longer appends a lengthy stack trace to the
  subject line.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-68">LBCLASSIC-68</a>
  reported by Gili Tzabari. In environments where the TCCL (Thread
  Context Class Laoder) was not set, logback was unable to located its
  default configuraiton files. Logback now uses the class loader that
  loaded logback itself to locate its resources instead of the
  TCCL. This approach is simpler and deemed to cover more
  environments, i.e. more widely applicable.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-24">LBGENERAL-24</a>
  reported by Thorbj&oslash;rn Ravn Andersen. Logback now relies on
  Geronimo JMS API specifications instead of Sun's JMS API
  specification, the latter requiring manual installation. With
  Geronimo JMS, logback can be built using Maven without needing to
  manually install any dependencies.

  <h3>26th of March 2008 - Release of version 0.9.9</h3>
  
   <p>MDC data in now inherited by child threads. This behaviour was
   already specified in the javadocs. The issue was raised by Martin
   Benda in <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=64">bug
   64</a> and independently by Peter Huber.
   </p>

   <p>Logback no longer includes retro-weaver generted jars for JDK
   1.4. There seemes to be little interest in JDK 1.4 builds. Calling
   retro-weaver increases logback's build time by a few seconds each
   time &ndash; seconds in which we can do more productive things.
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=104">bug
   104</a>, silly but but nonetheless serious copy-and-paste errors in
   the c.q.l.classic.Logger class, reported by Joern Huxhorn.
   </p>

   <p>Having been replaced by <code>SimpleSocketServer</code>, the
   <code>SocketServer</code> class has been removed.
   </p>
  
   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=105">bug
   105</a>, sockets created by <code>SocketAppenderBase</code> is now
   closed, reported by Joern Huxhorn. More generally,
   <code>SimpleSocketServer</code> is much more careful to track open
   client connections and to close them. 
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=110">bug
   110</a> in relation with the <code>requestParameterMap</code> field
   in <code>AccessEvent</code> - reported by Joern Huxhorn.
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66">
   SLF4J bug 66</a> in relation with caller data when using
   log4j-over-slf4j - reported by Frnack Routier.
  </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=129">bug
   129</a> reported by Michael Franz. As a result, Joran now supports
   nested as well as multiple file inclusions.
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=100">bug
   100</a> reported by Joern Huxhorn. At serialization time, object
   array passed as parameter, when the LoggingEvent is are now
   serialized as strings.
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=109">bug
   109</a> reported by Joern Huxhorn. There should no longer be any
   NullPointerExceptions thrown by deserialized
   <code>AccessEvent</code> instances.
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=8">bug
   8</a> reported by Sebastien Pennec. The documentation has been
   updated to reflect the fact that that in the context of conversion
   patterns the percent sign carries special meaning, in order to
   include the percent sign as a literal, it must be escaped with a
   backslash.
   </p>

   <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=52">bug
   52</a> reported by Kenichi Masuko. The bug has been fixed on March
   8th, 2007. Starting with this release, Joran will support the
   injection of any enum tpye, not just <code>FilterReply</code>.
   </p>

  <h3>22th of August 2007 - Release of version 0.9.8</h3>
  
  <p>This version of logback synchronizes with SLF4J version 1.4.3. In
  particular, logback now natively supports SLF4J's MDC API introduced
  in SLF4J version 1.4.1. If you are using SLF4J version 1.4.1 or
  later please make sure upgrade to logback version 0.9.8 or later.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed a number of documentation related bugs, in particular <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=90">bug 90</a> reported
  by Luc Maisonobe and <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=90">bug 88</a> reported
  by Sebastian Davids.
  </p>

  <p>It is now possible to include configuration file fragments (in
  XML) as a resource. Previously, it was only possible to include a
  file by specifying a path to a file or a URL.  This feature was
  requested by Michael Newcomb in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=89">bug 89</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed caller data extraction problem as reported in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=78">bug 78</a> by Hans
  van der Meer.
  </p>

  <p>The LoggingEvent class' constructor now correctly takes into
  account the argument array passed by the user. This problem was
  reported in <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=85">bug
  85</a> by Robert Christian.
  </p>

  <hr width="80%" align="center" />


  <h3>29th of May 2007 - Release of version 0.9.7</h3>


  <p>This release corrects packaging bugs <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=75">75</a> and <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=76">76</a> related to
  the migration of logback to SLF4J version 1.4.0. There are no other
  changes.
  </p>


  <hr width="80%" align="center" />

  <h3>23rd of May 2007 - Release of version 0.9.6</h3>


  <p>Logback is now aligned and compatible with SLF4J version 1.4.0,
  thus correcting <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=73">bug 73</a> as
  reported by Andy Gerweck.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> problem when running
  under JDK 1.4 <a
  href="http://www.qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2007-April/000206.html">as
  reported</a> by Brian Suksomwong.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=63">bug
  63</a> as reported by La Canea Rosario. Calling log4j (bridge) with
  the trace level will no longer cause an IllegalStateException to be
  thrown.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=70">bug
  70</a> as reported by Dirk Ooms. The %throwable conversion word is
  now recognized as documented in the logback manual. Moreover, the
  manual now mentions the %nopex word which can be used to force
  <code>PatternLayout</code> to ignore the exception contained in the
  logging request.
  </p>

  
  <p>As in most releases, the documentation has been improved.</p>

  <hr width="80%" align="center" />


  <h3>April 2nd, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.5</h3>

  <p>Fixed methods <code>isInfoEnabled</code>,
  <code>isWarnEnabled</code> and <code>isErrorEnabled</code> methods
  in <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code> class which failed to
  work correctly. This bug was reported today by Pavel Kral on the
  slf4j-user list. 
  </p>

  <p>Contrary to previous versions of logback, the various
  Logger.isXYZEnabled(Marker) methods now take into account the marker
  information passed as parameter.
  </p>


  <p>As discussed in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=54">bug 54</a>, during
  automatic initialization, it makes better sense to first check for
  <em>logback-test.xml</em> file and only if that fails, to check for
  <em>logback.xml</em>. Maven2 will guarantee that the
  logback-test.xml file, if places undder test/resources will not be
  included in the artifact it produces.
  </p>


  <hr width="80%" align="center" />
  
  <h3>March 29th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.4</h3>
    
  <p>Significant bug fixes made to <code>c.q.l.access.TeeFilter</code>
  and Co. Images and other binary files are now intercepted and
  replayed correctly. As for "x-www-form-urlencoded" post requests,
  their input buffer is left untouched. In a best-effort attempt, the
  input buffer for "x-www-form-urlencoded" post requests is later
  reconstructed through the request parameters. However, it may differ
  from the original buffer.
  </p>
    
  <p>The logback team released today the first version of a plugin for
  Eclipse that allows developpers to visualize logs generated by a
  running application.  It offers several nice features. Please check
  the <a href="consolePlugin.html">console plugin-in guide</a> for
  more details.
  </p>


  <h3>March 20th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.3</h3>
  
  <p>Includes in configuration files are now supported by Joran,
  logback's configuration framework. A file can contain an
  <em>include</em> element that has a <em>file</em> or <em>url</em>
  attribute pointing to a configuration file.  See the <a
  href="manual/joran.html#Include">chapter about configuration</a>
  in the logback's online manual for more information.
  </p>
    
  <p>Corrected bug 53 reported by Wilkins Poe. There is now a <a
  href="dependencies.html">dependencies page</a> that shows the
  requirements of each of logback's modules.
  </p>
    
  <p>After a <a
  href="http://www.slf4j.org/pipermail/user/2007-March/000297.html">
  discussion on the SLF4J mailing list</a> started by Franck Routier,
  a correction has been made when logging using the
  <em>JCL104-over-slf4j</em> module. Logback now correctly shows the
  caller location information.
  </p>
    
  <p>As in most logback releases, the documentation has been improved.
  </p>
    

    <h3>March 5th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.2</h3>
    
    <p>The documentation is now in the <em>docs/</em> directory to allow an
    easier access to the logback manual and website for offline viewing.
    </p>

		<h3>March 5th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.1</h3>

    <p>Logback-class now depends on SLF4J version 1.3.0 instead of
    1.2.</p>

    <p>Numerous improvements to the documentation.</p>

		<p><a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=46">Bug #46</a>
		reported by Mark Renyolds has been fixed. The
		<code>TimeUtilTest</code> should now run fine under any time
		zone.</p>
		
    <p><a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=45">Bug
    #45</a>, also reported by Mark Reynolds, has been fixed. There
    should be no <code>ClassCastException</code> thrown anymore when
    passing an <code>Object</code> to the printing methods using the
    log4j-bridge module. </p>

    <hr width="80%" align="center" />

		<h3>January 31st, 2007 - Release of version 0.9</h3>

    <p>
      This version contains a new component, namely the
      <code>ContextSelector</code>, that provides context separation
      and management when logback is used by several web-apps running
      under the same server. A <a
      href="manual/contextSelector.html">new chapter</a> was added to
      the logback manual to detail the use of the
      <code>ContextSelector</code>, along with its associated
      components.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <code>JMXConfigurator</code> has been improved. It now shows
      the context's Status objects, which lets users check the
      internal state of logback.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The logback manual's chapter 2, about <a
      href="manual/architecture.html">logback's architecture</a>, has
      been updated with two sections: Under the hood and Performance.
    </p>
    
		<hr width="80%" align="center" />

    <h3>January 23th, 2007 - Release of version 0.8.1</h3>

    <p>

      allowing users to display the full HttpServletRequest or
      HttpServletResponse of an access event.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The documentation section has been updated. The short introduction was split
      into the chapter 1 and chapter 2 of the logback manual. The chapters about
      Appenders and Layouts have been updated to document new components of logback.
    </p>
    
    <p>A demonstration webApp presenting logback's major components is
    available.  A document explains how to run it, and provides a
    step-by-step visit of the demo.
    </p>
    
    <p>A first translation of logback jars to JDK1.4 is present in
    this release.
    </p>

		<p>Several new components have been added to logback. A JMX
		Configurator now allows users to see and modify loggers or reload
		configuration among other possibilities.  A <a
		href="jmxConfig.html">document</a> about this configurator is
		available in the <a href="documentation.html">corresponding
		section</a> of the site. We'd like to thank Sebastian Davids for
		his ideas and contributions to this component.
		</p>
		
		<p>A JMSTopicAppender and JMSQueueAppender are now available, as
		well as two new filters: LevelFilter and ThresholdFilter. A
		refactoring was done in the filters objects to ease the
		implementation of custom filters.
