    <h2>What is logback?</h2>

    <a href="introduction_ja.html">&#x548C;&#x8A33; (Japanese translation)</a>
  
    <p>Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j
    project.  It was designed by Ceki G&#252;lc&#252;, log4j's
    founder.  It builds upon a decade of experience gained in
    designing industrial-strength logging systems. The resulting
    product, i.e. logback, is faster and has a smaller footprint than
    all existing logging systems, sometimes by a wide margin. Just as
    importantly, logback offers <a
    href="../reasonsToSwitch.html">unique and rather useful
    features</a> missing in other logging systems.
    </p>

    <h2>First Baby Step</h2>

    <script src="../templates/setup.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
    <a name="Requirements"></a>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>Logback-classic module requires the presence of
    <em>slf4j-api.jar</em> and <em>logback-core.jar</em> in addition to
    <em>logback-classic.jar</em> on the classpath.
    </p>

    <p>The <em>logback-*.jar</em> files are part of the logback
    distribution whereas <em>slf4j-api-${slf4j.version}.jar</em> ships
    with <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J</a>, a separate project.
    </p>

    <p>Let us now begin experimenting with logback.</p>

<em>Example 1.1: Basic template for logging (<a href="../xref/chapters/introduction/HelloWorld1.html">logback-examples/src/main/java/chapters/introduction/HelloWorld1.java</a>)</em>
<pre class="prettyprint source">package chapters.introduction;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class HelloWorld1 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("chapters.introduction.HelloWorld1");
    logger.debug("Hello world.");

  }
}</pre>

    <p><code>HelloWorld1</code> class is defined in the
    <code>chapters.introduction</code> package. It starts by importing the <a
    href="http://slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/Logger.html"><code>Logger</code></a>
    and <a
    href="http://slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/LoggerFactory.html"><code>LoggerFactory</code></a>
    classes defined in the SLF4J API, specifically within the
     <code>org.slf4j</code> package.
    </p>


    <p>On the first line of the main() method, the variable named
    <code>logger</code> is assigned a <code>Logger</code> instance
    retrieved by invoking the static <code>getLogger</code> method
    from the <code>LoggerFactory</code> class.  This logger is named
    "chapters.introduction.HelloWorld1". The main method proceeds to call the
    <code>debug</code> method of this logger passing "Hello World" as
    an argument.  We say that the main method contains a logging
    statement of level DEBUG with the message "Hello world".
    </p>

    <p>Note that the above example does not reference any logback
    classes. In most cases, as far as logging is concerned, your
    classes will only need to import SLF4J classes. Thus, the vast
    majority, if not all, of your classes will use the SLF4J
    API and will be oblivious to the existence of logback.
    </p>


    <p>You can launch the first
    sample application, <em>chapters.introduction.HelloWorld1</em> with the command:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>java chapters.introduction.HelloWorld1</pre></div>

    <p>Launching the <code>HelloWorld1</code> application will output
    a single line on the console. By virtue of logback's default
    configuration policy, when no default configuration file is found,
    logback will add a <code>ConsoleAppender</code> to the root
    logger.
    </p>

    <p class="source">20:49:07.962 [main] DEBUG chapters.introduction.HelloWorld1 - Hello world.</p>

    <p>Logback can report information about its internal state using a
    built-in status system. Important events occurring during logback's
    lifetime can be accessed through a component called
    <code>StatusManager</code>. For the time being, let us instruct
    logback to print its internal state by invoking the static
    <code>print()</code> method of the <code>StatusPrinter</code>
    class.
    </p>

<em>Example: Printing Logger Status (<a href="../xref/chapters/introduction/HelloWorld2.html">logback-examples/src/main/java/chapters/introduction/HelloWorld2.java</a>)</em>
<pre class="prettyprint source">package chapters.introduction;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
<b>import ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext;
import ch.qos.logback.core.util.StatusPrinter;</b>

public class HelloWorld2 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("chapters.introduction.HelloWorld2");
    logger.debug("Hello world.");

    // print internal state
    <b>LoggerContext lc = (LoggerContext) LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory();
    StatusPrinter.print(lc);</b>
  }
}</pre>


   <p>Running the <code>HelloWorld2</code> application will produce
   the following output:</p>

<div class="source longline"><pre>12:49:22.203 [main] DEBUG chapters.introduction.HelloWorld2 - Hello world.
12:49:22,076 |-INFO in ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext[default] - Could NOT find resource [logback.groovy]
12:49:22,078 |-INFO in ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext[default] - Could NOT find resource [logback-test.xml]
12:49:22,093 |-INFO in ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext[default] - Could NOT find resource [logback.xml]
12:49:22,093 |-INFO in ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext[default] - Setting up default configuration.
</pre></div>


  <p>Logback explains that having failed to find the
  <em>logback-test.xml</em> and <em>logback.xml</em> configuration
  files (discussed later), it configured itself using its default
  policy, which is a basic <code>ConsoleAppender</code>.  An
  <code>Appender</code> is a class that can be seen as an output
  destination. Appenders exist for many different destinations
  including the console, files, Syslog, TCP Sockets, JMS and many
  more. Users can also easily create their own Appenders as
  appropriate for their specific situation.
  </p>

  <p>Note that in case of errors, logback will automatically print its
  internal state on the console.</p>

  <p>The previous examples are rather simple. Actual logging in a
  larger application would not be that different. The general pattern
  for logging statements would not change. Only the configuration
  process would be different. However, you would probably want to
  customize or configure logback according to your needs. Logback
  configuration will be covered in subsequent chapters.
  </p>

  <p>Note that in the above example we have instructed logback to
  print its internal state by invoking the
  <code>StatusPrinter.print()</code> method. Logback's internal status
  information can be very useful in diagnosing logback-related
  problems.
  </p>

  <p>Here is a list of the three required steps in order to enable
  logging in your application.
  </p>

  <ol> 
    <li>Configure the logback environment. You can do so in several
    more or less sophisticated ways. More on this later.</li>

    <li>In every class where you wish to perform logging, retrieve a
    <code>Logger</code> instance by invoking the
    <code>org.slf4j.LoggerFactory</code> class'
    <code>getLogger()</code> method, passing the current class name
    or the class itself as a parameter.</li>
    
    <li>Use this logger instance by invoking its printing methods,
    namely the debug(), info(), warn() and error() methods. This will
    produce logging output on the configured appenders.</li>
  </ol>
 
  
  <h2 class="doAnchor" name="building">Building logback</h2>
  
  <p>As its build tool, logback relies on <a
  href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>, a widely-used open-source
  build tool.
  </p>

  <p>Once you have installed Maven, building the logback project,
  including all its modules, should be as easy as issuing a <code>mvn
  install</code> command from within the directory where you
  unarchived the logback distribution. Maven will automatically
  download the required external libraries.
  </p>

  <p>Logback distributions contain complete source code such that you
  can modify parts of logback library and build your own version of
  it. You may even redistribute the modified version, as long as you
  adhere to the conditions of the LGPL license or the EPL license.
  </p>

  <p>For building logback under an IDE, please see the <a
  href="../setup.html#ide">relevant section on the class path setup
  page</a>.</p>
