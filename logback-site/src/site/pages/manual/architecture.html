    <h2>Logback's architecture</h2>

    <p>Logback's basic architecture is sufficiently generic so as to
    apply under different circumstances. At the present time, logback
    is divided into three modules, logback-core, logback-classic and
    logback-access.
    </p>

    <p>The <em>core</em> module lays the groundwork for the other two
    modules.  The <em>classic</em> module extends <em>core</em>. The
    classic module corresponds to a significantly improved version of
    log4j. Logback-classic natively implements the <a
    href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J API</a> so that you can readily
    switch back and forth between logback and other logging systems
    such as log4j or java.util.logging (JUL) introduced in JDK
    1.4. The third module called <em>access</em> integrates with
    Servlet containers to provide HTTP-access log functionality. A
    separate document covers <a href="../access.html">access module
    documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>In the remainder of this document, we will write "logback" to
    refer to the logback-classic module.
    </p>
    
		<h2>Logger, Appenders and Layouts</h2>
		
		<p>Logback is built upon three main classes: <code>Logger</code>,
		<code>Appender</code> and <code>Layout</code>. These three types
		of components work together to enable developers to log messages
		according to message type and level, and to control at runtime how
		these messages are formatted and where they are reported.
		</p>

		<p>The <code>Logger</code> class is part of the logback-classic
		module. On the other hand, the <code>Appender</code> and
		<code>Layout</code> interfaces are part of logback-core. As a
		general-purpose module, logback-core has no notion of
		loggers.
		</p>
    
    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="LoggerContext">Logger context</h3>

		<p>The first and foremost advantage of any logging API over plain
		<code>System.out.println</code> resides in its ability to disable
		certain log statements while allowing others to print
		unhindered. This capability assumes that the logging space, that
		is, the space of all possible logging statements, is categorized
		according to some developer-chosen criteria.  In logback-classic,
		this categorization is an inherent part of loggers.  Every single
		logger is attached to a <code>LoggerContext</code> which is
		responsible for manufacturing loggers as well as arranging them in
		a tree like hierarchy.
		</p>
			
		<p>Loggers are named entities. Their names are case-sensitive and
		they follow the hierarchical naming rule:
		</p>

		<div class="definition">
			<div class="deftitle">Named Hierarchy</div>
			<p>
				A logger is said to be an ancestor of another logger if
				its name followed by a dot is a prefix of the descendant
				logger name. A logger is said to be a parent of a child
				logger if there are no ancestors between itself and the
				descendant logger.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>For example, the logger named <code>"com.foo"</code> is a
		parent of the logger named <code>"com.foo.Bar"</code>.  Similarly,
		<code>"java"</code> is a parent of <code>"java.util"</code> and an
		ancestor of <code>"java.util.Vector"</code>.  This naming scheme
		should be familiar to most developers.
		</p>

		<p>The root logger resides at the top of the logger hierarchy.  It
		is exceptional in that it is part of every hierarchy at its
		inception. Like every logger, it can be retrieved by its name, as
		follows:
		</p>
		
    <pre class="prettyprint source">Logger rootLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(<a
    href="http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/constant-values.html#org.slf4j.Logger.ROOT_LOGGER_NAME">org.slf4j.Logger.ROOT_LOGGER_NAME</a>);</pre>

		<p>All other loggers are also retrieved with the class static
		<code>getLogger</code> method found in the <a
		href="http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">org.slf4j.LoggerFactory</a>
		class. This method takes the name of the desired logger as a
		parameter. Some of the basic methods in the <code>Logger</code>
		interface are listed below.
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint source">package org.slf4j; 
public interface Logger {

  // Printing methods: 
  public void trace(String message);
  public void debug(String message);
  public void info(String message); 
  public void warn(String message); 
  public void error(String message); 
}</pre>



    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="effectiveLevel">Effective Level aka
    Level Inheritance </h3>

		<p>Loggers may be assigned levels. The set of possible levels
		(TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR) are defined in the
		<code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Level</code> class. Note that in
		logback, the <code>Level</code> class is final and cannot be
		sub-classed, as a much more flexible approach exists in the form
		of <code>Marker</code> objects.
		</p>

		<p>If a given logger is not assigned a level, then it inherits one
		from its closest ancestor with an assigned level. More formally:
		</p>

		<div class="definition">
		
      
			<p>The effective level for a given logger <em>L</em>, is equal
			to the first non-null level in its hierarchy, starting at
			<em>L</em> itself and proceeding upwards in the hierarchy
			towards the root logger.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<p>To ensure that all loggers can eventually inherit a level, the
		root logger always has an assigned level. By default, this level
		is DEBUG.
		</p>

		<p>Below are four examples with various assigned level values and
		the resulting effective (inherited) levels according to the level
		inheritance rule.
		</p>

		<em>Example 1</em>
		<table class="bodyTable">
			<tr>
				<th>Logger name</th>
				<th>Assigned level</th>
				<th>Effective level</th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt">
				<td>root</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
		  </tr>
			<tr>
				<td>X</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
		  </tr>

			<tr class="alt">
				<td>X.Y</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
		  </tr>
			<tr>
				<td>X.Y.Z</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
		  </tr>
  </table>

		<p> In example 1 above, only the root logger is assigned a level.
		This level value, <code>DEBUG</code>, is inherited by the other
		loggers <code>X</code>, <code>X.Y</code> and <code>X.Y.Z</code>
		</p>

		<em>Example 2</em>
		<table class="bodyTable">
			<tr>
				<th>Logger name</th>
				<th>Assigned level</th>
				<th>Effective level</th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt" align="left">
				<td>root</td>
				<td>ERROR</td>
				<td>ERROR</td>
			</tr>
			<tr align="left">
				<td>X</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
			</tr>

			<tr class="alt" align="left">
				<td>X.Y</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
			</tr>
			<tr align="left">
				<td>X.Y.Z</td>
				<td>WARN</td>
				<td>WARN</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>In example 2 above, all loggers have an assigned level value.
		Level inheritance does not come into play.
		</p>

		<em>Example 3</em>
		<table class="bodyTable">
			<tr>
				<th>Logger name</th>
				<th>Assigned level</th>
				<th>Effective level</th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt" align="left">
				<td>root</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
			</tr>

			<tr align="left">
				<td>X</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt" align="left">
				<td>X.Y</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
			</tr>
			<tr align="left">
				<td>X.Y.Z</td>
				<td>ERROR</td>
				<td>ERROR</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>In example 3 above, the loggers <code>root</code>,
		<code>X</code> and <code>X.Y.Z</code> are assigned the levels
		<code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code> and <code>ERROR</code>
		respectively. Logger <code>X.Y</code> inherits its level value
		from its parent <code>X</code>.
		</p>

		<em>Example 4</em>
		<table class="bodyTable">

			<tr>
				<th>Logger name</th>
				<th>Assigned level</th>
				<th>Effective level</th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt" align="left">
				<td>root</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
				<td>DEBUG</td>
			</tr>

			<tr align="left">
				<td>X</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt" align="left">
				<td>X.Y</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
			</tr>
			<tr align="left">
				<td>X.Y.Z</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>INFO</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

   
		<p>In example 4 above, the loggers <code>root</code> and
		<code>X</code> and are assigned the levels <code>DEBUG</code> and
		<code>INFO</code> respectively. The loggers <code>X.Y</code> and
		<code>X.Y.Z</code> inherit their level value from their nearest
		parent <code>X</code>, which has an assigned level.
		</p>

    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="basic_selection">Printing methods and
    the basic selection rule</h3>

		<p>By definition, the printing method determines the level of a
		logging request. For example, if <code>L</code> is a logger
		instance, then the statement <code>L.info("..")</code> is a
		logging statement of level INFO.
		</p>
		
    
    <p>A logging request is said to be <em>enabled</em> if its level
    is higher than or equal to the effective level of its
    logger. Otherwise, the request is said to be <em>disabled</em>. As
    described previously, a logger without an assigned level will
    inherit one from its nearest ancestor. This rule is summarized
    below.
  </p>

     
		<div class="definition">
			<div class="deftitle">Basic Selection Rule</div>

			<p>A log request of level <em>p</em> issued to a logger having
			an effective level <em>q</em>, is enabled if
			<em>p&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;q</em>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>This rule is at the heart of logback. It assumes that levels
		are ordered as follows:
		<code>TRACE&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;DEBUG&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;INFO&nbsp;&lt;
		&nbsp;WARN&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;ERROR</code>.
		</p>
				
		<p>In a more graphic way, here is how the selection rule works. In
		the following table, the vertical header shows the level of
		the logging request, designated by <em>p</em>, while the
		horizontal header shows effective level of the logger, designated
		by <em>q</em>. The intersection of the rows (level request) and
		columns (effective level) is the boolean resulting from the basic
		selection rule.
		</p>
		
		<table width="80%">

    <a name="RetrievingLoggers"></a>
		<h3>Retrieving Loggers</h3>
		<p>
			Calling the <code><a href="../apidocs/org/slf4j/LoggerFactory.html#getLogger(java.lang.String)">LoggerFactory.getLogger</a></code>
			method with the same name will always return a reference to
			the exact same logger object.
		</p>

		<p>For example, in</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint source">Logger x = LoggerFactory.getLogger("wombat"); 
Logger y = LoggerFactory.getLogger("wombat");</pre>

		<p>
			<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> refer to
			<em>exactly</em> the same logger object.
		</p>

		<p>Thus, it is possible to configure a logger and then to retrieve
		the same instance somewhere else in the code without passing
		around references. In fundamental contradiction to biological
		parenthood, where parents always precede their children, logback
		loggers can be created and configured in any order. In particular,
		a "parent" logger will find and link to its descendants even if it
		is instantiated after them.
		</p>
		<p>Configuration of the logback environment is typically done at
		application initialization. The preferred way is by reading a
		configuration file. This approach will be discussed shortly.
		</p>
		<p>Logback makes it easy to name loggers by <em>software
		component</em>.  This can be accomplished by instantiating a
		logger in each class, with the logger name equal to the fully
		qualified name of the class. This is a useful and straightforward
		method of defining loggers. As the log output bears the name of
		the generating logger, this naming strategy makes it easy to
		identify the origin of a log message. However, this is only one
		possible, albeit common, strategy for naming loggers. Logback does
		not restrict the possible set of loggers. As a developer, you are
		free to name loggers as you wish.
		</p>

		<p>Nevertheless, naming loggers after the class where they are
		located seems to be the best general strategy known so far.
		</p>

    <a name="AppendersAndLayouts"></a>
    <h3>Appenders and Layouts</h3>

		<p>The ability to selectively enable or disable logging requests
		based on their logger is only part of the picture.  Logback allows
		logging requests to print to multiple destinations. In logback
		speak, an output destination is called an appender. Currently,
		appenders exist for the console, files, remote socket servers, to
		MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and other databases, JMS, and remote
		UNIX Syslog daemons.

      <!--It is also possible to log asynchronously. -->
		</p>

		<p>More than one appender can be attached to a logger.</p>

    <p>The <code><a
    href="../apidocs/ch/qos/logback/classic/Logger.html#addAppender(ch.qos.logback.core.Appender)">addAppender</a></code>
    method adds an appender to a given logger.  Each enabled logging
    request for a given logger will be forwarded to all the appenders
    in that logger as well as the appenders higher in the
    hierarchy. In other words, appenders are inherited additively from
    the logger hierarchy. For example, if a console appender is added
    to the root logger, then all enabled logging requests will at
    least print on the console. If in addition a file appender is
    added to a logger, say <em>L</em>, then enabled logging requests
    for <em>L</em> and <em>L</em>'s children will print on a file
    <em>and</em> on the console.  It is possible to override this
    default behavior so that appender accumulation is no longer
    additive by setting the additivity flag of a logger to false.
		</p>

		<p>The rules governing appender additivity are summarized below.
		</p>
		<div class="definition">

			<h4 class="deftitle"><a name="additivity"
			href="#additivity"><span class="anchor"/></a>Appender
			Additivity</h4>

			<p>The output of a log statement of logger <em>L</em> will go to
			all the appenders in <em>L</em> and its ancestors. This is the
			meaning of the term "appender additivity".
			</p>

			<p>However, if an ancestor of logger <em>L</em>, say <em>P</em>,
			has the additivity flag set to false, then <em>L</em>'s output
			will be directed to all the appenders in <em>L</em> and its
			ancestors up to and including <em>P</em> but not the appenders in
			any of the ancestors of <em>P</em>.
			</p>

			<p>Loggers have their additivity flag set to true by default.
			</p>

		</div>
		The table below shows an example:

		<table class="bodyTable">
			<tr>
				<th>Logger Name</th>
				<th>Attached Appenders</th>
				<th>Additivity Flag</th>
				<th>Output Targets</th>
				<th>Comment</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>root</td>
				<td>A1</td>
				<td>not applicable</td>
				<td>A1</td>

				<td>Since the root logger stands at the top of the logger
				hierarchy, the additivity flag does not apply to it.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt">
				<td>x</td>
				<td>A-x1, A-x2</td>
				<td>true</td>
				<td>A1, A-x1, A-x2</td>
				<td>Appenders of "x" and of root.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>x.y</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>true</td>
				<td>A1, A-x1, A-x2</td>
				<td>Appenders of "x" and of root.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt">
				<td>x.y.z</td>
				<td>A-xyz1</td>
				<td>true</td>
				<td>A1, A-x1, A-x2, A-xyz1</td>
				<td>Appenders of "x.y.z", "x" and of root.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>security</td>
				<td>A-sec</td>
				<td class="blue"><span class="blue">false</span></td>
				<td>A-sec</td>

				<td>
					No appender accumulation since the additivity flag is set to
					<code>false</code>. Only appender A-sec will be used.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="alt">
				<td>security.access</td>
				<td>none</td>
				<td>true</td>				
        <td>A-sec</td>
				<td>
					Only appenders of "security" because the additivity
					flag in "security" is set to
					<code>false</code>.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>


		<p>More often than not, users wish to customize not only the
		output destination but also the output format. This is
		accomplished by associating a <em>layout</em> with an
		appender. The layout is responsible for formatting the logging
		request according to the user's wishes, whereas an appender takes
		care of sending the formatted output to its destination. The
		<code>PatternLayout</code>, part of the standard logback
		distribution, lets the user specify the output format according to
		conversion patterns similar to the C language <code>printf</code>
		function.
		</p>

		<p>For example, the PatternLayout with the conversion pattern
		"%-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger{32} - %msg%n" will output
		something akin to:
		</p>

		<div class="prettyprint source"><pre>176  [main] DEBUG manual.architecture.HelloWorld2 - Hello world.</pre></div>

		<p>The first field is the number of milliseconds elapsed since the
		start of the program. The second field is the thread making the
		log request. The third field is the level of the log request. The
		fourth field is the name of the logger associated with the log
		request. The text after the '-' is the message of the request.

		<pre class="prettyprint source">logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));</pre>

		<p>incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that is
		converting both integer <code>i</code> and <code>entry[i]</code>
		to a String, and concatenating intermediate strings. This is
		regardless of whether the message will be logged or not.
		</p>

		<p>One possible way to avoid the cost of parameter construction is
		by surrounding the log statement with a test. Here is an example.
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint source">if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) { 
  logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
}</pre>


		<p>This way you will not incur the cost of parameter construction
		if debugging is disabled for <code>logger</code>.  On the other
		hand, if the logger is enabled for the DEBUG level, you will incur
		the cost of evaluating whether the logger is enabled or not,
		twice: once in <code>debugEnabled</code> and once in
		<code>debug</code>.  In practice, this overhead is insignificant
		because evaluating a logger takes less than 1% of the time it
		takes to actually log a request.
		</p>

		<h4>Better alternative</h4>

		<p>There exists a convenient alternative based on message
		formats. Assuming <code>entry</code> is an object, you can write:
		</p>


		<pre class="prettyprint source">Object entry = new SomeObject(); 
logger.debug("The entry is {}.", entry);</pre>

		<p>Only after evaluating whether to log or not, and only if the decision
		is positive, will the logger implementation format the message and
		replace the '{}' pair with the string value of <code>entry</code>.
		In other words, this form does not incur the cost of parameter
		construction when the log statement is disabled.
		</p>


		<p>The following two lines will yield the exact same output.
		However, in case of a <em>disabled</em> logging statement, the
		second variant will outperform the first variant by a factor of at
		least 30.
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint source">logger.debug("The new entry is "+entry+".");
logger.debug("The new entry is {}.", entry);</pre>


		<p>A two argument variant is also available. For example, you can
		write:
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint source">logger.debug("The new entry is {}. It replaces {}.", entry, oldEntry);</pre>

		<p>If three or more arguments need to be passed, an
		<code>Object[]</code> variant is also available. For example, you
		can write:
		</p>


		<pre class="prettyprint source">Object[] paramArray = {newVal, below, above};
logger.debug("Value {} was inserted between {} and {}.", paramArray);</pre>

  <h3>A peek under the hood</h3>

  <p>After we have introduced the essential logback components, we are
  now ready to describe the steps that the logback framework takes
  when the user invokes a logger's printing method. Let us now analyze
  the steps logback takes when the user invokes the
  <code>info()</code> method of a logger named <em>com.wombat</em>.
  </p>

  <h4>1. Get the filter chain decision</h4>

  <p>If it exists, the <code>TurboFilter</code> chain is
  invoked. Turbo filters can set a context-wide threshold, or filter
  out certain events based on information such as <code>Marker</code>,
  <code>Level</code>, <code>Logger</code>, message, or the
  <code>Throwable</code> that are associated with each logging
  request.  If the reply of the filter chain is
  <code>FilterReply.DENY</code>, then the logging request is
  dropped. If it is <code>FilterReply.NEUTRAL</code>, then we continue
  with the next step, i.e. step 2. In case the reply is
  <code>FilterReply.ACCEPT</code>, we skip the next and directly jump
  to step 3.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Apply the <a href="#basic_selection">basic selection
  rule</a></h4>

  <p>At this step, logback compares the effective level of the logger
  with the level of the request. If the logging request is disabled
  according to this test, then logback will drop the request without
  further processing. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Create a <code>LoggingEvent</code> object</h4>

  <p>If the request survived the previous filters, logback will
  create a <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggingEvent</code> object
  containing all the relevant parameters of the request, such as the
  logger of the request, the request level, the message itself, the
  exception that might have been passed along with the request, the
  current time, the current thread, various data about the class that
  issued the logging request and the <code>MDC</code>. Note that some
  of these fields are initialized lazily, that is only when they are
  actually needed. The <code>MDC</code> is used to decorate the
  logging request with additional contextual information. MDC is
  discussed in a <a href="mdc.html">subsequent chapter</a>.</p>

  <h4>4. Invoking appenders</h4>

  <p>After the creation of a <code>LoggingEvent</code> object, logback
  will invoke the <code>doAppend()</code> methods of all the
  applicable appenders, that is, the appenders inherited from the
  logger context.
  </p>

  <p>All appenders shipped with the logback distribution extend the
  <code>AppenderBase</code> abstract class that implements the
  <code>doAppend</code> method in a synchronized block ensuring
  thread-safety.  The <code>doAppend()</code> method of
  <code>AppenderBase</code> also invokes custom filters attached to
  the appender, if any such filters exist.  Custom filters, which can
  be dynamically attached to any appender, are presented in a <a
  href="filters.html">separate chapter</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Formatting the output</h4>

  <p>It is responsibility of the invoked appender to format the
  logging event. However, some (but not all) appenders delegate the
  task of formatting the logging event to a layout. A layout formats
  the <code>LoggingEvent</code> instance and returns the result as a
  String. Note that some appenders, such as the
  <code>SocketAppender</code>, do not transform the logging event into
  a string but serialize it instead.  Consequently, they do not
  have nor require a layout.
  </p>

  <h4>6. Sending out the <code>LoggingEvent</code></h4>

  <p>After the logging event is fully formatted it is sent to its
  destination by each appender.
  </p>
  
  <p>

  <h3 class="doAnchor" name="performance">Performance</h3>

  <p>One of the often-cited arguments against logging is its
  computational cost.  This is a legitimate concern as even
  moderately-sized applications can generate thousands of log
  requests. Much of our development effort is spent measuring and
  tweaking logback's performance.  Independently of these efforts, the
  user should still be aware of the following performance issues.
  </p>

  <h4>1. Logging performance when logging is turned off entirely</h4>

  <p>You can turn off logging entirely by setting the level of the
  root logger to <code>Level.OFF</code>, the highest possible level.
  When logging is turned off entirely, the cost of a log request
  consists of a method invocation plus an integer comparison. On a
  3.2Ghz Pentium D machine this cost is typically around 20
  nanoseconds.
  </p>

  <p>However, any method invocation involves the "hidden" cost of
  parameter construction.  For example, for some logger <em>x</em>
  writing,
  </p>
  
  <pre class="prettyprint source">x.debug("Entry number: " + i + "is " + entry[i]);</pre>

  <p>incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter,
  i.e. converting both integer <code>i</code> and
  <code>entry[i]</code> to a string, and concatenating intermediate
  strings, regardless of whether the message will be logged or not.
  </p>

  <p>The cost of parameter construction can be quite high and depends
  on the size of the parameters involved. To avoid the cost of
  parameter construction you can take advantage of SLF4J's parameterized
  logging:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source">x.debug("Entry number: {} is {}", i, entry[i]);</pre>

  <p>This variant will not incur the cost of parameter
  construction. Compared to the previous call to the
  <code>debug()</code> method, it will be faster by a wide margin.
  The message will be formatted only if the logging request is to be
  sent to attached appenders. Moreover, the component that formats
  messages is highly optimized.
  </p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the above placing log statements in tight loops,
  i.e. very frequently invoked code, is a lose-lose proposal, likely
  to result in degraded performance.  Logging in tight loops will slow
  down your application even if logging is turned off, and if logging
  is turned on, will generate massive (and hence useless) output.
  </p>

  <h4>2. The performance of deciding whether to log or not to log when
  logging is turned on.</h4>

  <p>In logback, there is no need to walk the logger hierarchy. A
  logger knows its effective level (that is, its level, once level
  inheritance has been taken into consideration) when it is
  created. Should the level of a parent logger be changed, then all
  child loggers are contacted to take notice of the change. Thus,
  before accepting or denying a request based on the effective level,
  the logger can make a quasi-instantaneous decision, without needing
  to consult its ancestors.
  </p>


  <h4>3. Actual logging (formatting and writing to the output device)</h4>

  <p>This is the cost of formatting the log output and sending it to
  its target destination. Here again, a serious effort was made to
  make layouts (formatters) perform as quickly as possible.  The same
  is true for appenders. The typical cost of actually logging is about
  9 to 12 microseconds when logging to a file on the local machine.
  It goes up to several milliseconds when logging to a database on a
  remote server.
  </p>

  <p>Although feature-rich, one of the foremost design goals of
  logback was speed of execution, a requirement which is second only
  to reliability. Some logback components have been rewritten several
  times to improve performance.
