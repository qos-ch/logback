		<h2>Logback Team</h2>

		<p>Let us introduce you to the logback team members:</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/jeannoel.gif" alt="Jean-Noel"/></td>
				<td>
					Jean-Noel Charpin has been designing and developing object oriented software 
					and decision making systems since 1998. He is particularly interested in 
					translating lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development
					domain in order to improve quality and reliability.
				</td>

				<td><img src="images/ceki.gif" alt="Ceki"/></td>
				<td>
          <p>Ceki G&#252;lc&#252; has been working on logging systems
          since 1996.  He is the founder of the log4j, slf4j and
          logback projects.  Ceki enjoys writing software, a task far
          more difficult and time-consuming than what it seems at
          first sight.  His interests range from cryptography, systems
          monitoring and testing to application interoperability.
          </p>

          <p>One of the core lessons he has learned over the years is
          that unit tests lie at the heart of maintainable
          software. Adding tests towards the end of development cycle
          yields poor results. Tests must be an inherent part of the
          development process right from the start.
          </p>

          <p>When not busy programming, Ceki enjoys watching the
          Simpsons on DVD or alternatively preparing sushis for his
          friends.
          </p>

				<td>
					<p>S&#233;bastien Pennec has been using computers for the most
					part of his life, be it as a hobby, or during his studies
					or, more recently, as Software Engineer. He loves to write
					software in dynamic and enthusiastic environments, while
					learning new technologies and practices.
					</p>
					<p>
						S&#233;bastien's hobbys include writing articles about
						Macintosh products on <a href="http://www.cuk.ch">cuk.ch</a>, 
						digital photography and playing poker with his friends.
