Justification for CLAs
----------------------

There is no denying that the CLA requirement adds overhead. However,
the CLA offers several advantages:

advantage 1) having a CLA on file for all contributors provides
reassurance to downstream users. For example, IP officers from Eclipse
contact QOS.ch at regular intervals asking whether QOS.ch has CLA for
all SLF4J and logback contributions.

advantage 2) allows QOS.ch to change the software license as long as
the change is not contrary to public interest. This allowed QOS.ch to
add Eclipse Public License 1.0 (in addition to LGPL) in logback
version 0.9.18. This was undoubtedly a net gain for those wishing to
use logback and it was a fairly painless process. Without the CLA on
file, dual-licensing logback would have been near impossible.

advantage 3) by virtue of clause 3 of the CLA, the contributor vouches
for his/her contributions as his/her own. Thus, QOS.ch takes a lesser
risk when distributing software because QOS.ch can claim that some
vetting has been performed (due dillegence).

A more neutral discussion of CLAs can be found at [2].

BTW, the CLA can be sent to Ceki directly by email (a scanned copy is
fine).
