Justification for CLAs
----------------------

The CLA requirement adds a bureaucratic step before contributions can
be accepted. However, the CLA offers several advantages:
  
1) having a CLA on file for all contributors provides reassurance to
downstream users. For example, IP officers from Eclipse foundation
contact QOS.ch at regular intervals asking whether QOS.ch has CLA for
SLF4J and logback contributions.

2) allows QOS.ch to change the software license as long as the change
is not contrary to public interest. This allowed QOS.ch to add Eclipse
Public License 1.0 (in addition to LGPL) in logback version
0.9.18. This was undoubtedly a net gain for those wishing to use
logback and it was a fairly painless process. Without the CLA on file,
dual-licensing logback would have been near impossible.

3) by virtue of clauses 4 and 5 of the CLA, the contributor vouches
for his/her contributions as his/her own and that he/she is entitled
to grant the license. Thus, QOS.ch takes a lesser risk when
distributing software because QOS.ch can claim that some vetting has
been performed (due diligence).

A more detailed discussion of CLAs can be found at [2].

BTW, the CLA can be sent to Ceki directly by email. A scanned copy on
two separate pages is fine but please make sure that the images render
reasonably well when printed on a laser printer. Images taken by
cellphone cameras often render as a large gray smudge when printed.
