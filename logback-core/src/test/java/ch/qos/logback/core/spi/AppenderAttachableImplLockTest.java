/**
 * This test shows the general problem I described in LBCORE-67.
 *
 * In the two test cases below, an appender that throws an OutOfMemoryError
 * while getName is called - but this is just an example to show the general
 * problem.
 *
 * The tests below fail without fixing LBCORE-67 and pass when Joern Huxhorn's
 * patch is applied.
 *
 * Additionally, the following, probably more realistic, situations could
 * happen:
 *
 * -addAppender: appenderList.add() could throw OutOfMemoryError. This could
 * only be shown by using an appenderList mock but appenderList does not (and
 * should not) have a setter. This would leave the write lock locked.
 *
 * -iteratorForAppenders: new ArrayList() could throw an OutOfMemoryError,
 * leaving the read lock locked.
 *
 * I can't imagine a bad situation in isAttached, detachAppender(Appender) or
 * detachAppender(String) but I'd change the code anyway for consistency. I'm
 * also pretty sure that something stupid can happen at any time so it's best to
 * just stick to conventions.
