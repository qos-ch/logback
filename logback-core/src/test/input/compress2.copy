  <h1>LOGBack project</h1>

  <p>LOGBack is intended as a successor to the popular log4j
  project. It was also designed by Ceki G&#252;lc&#252;, the founder
  of the log4j project. It builds upon exerience gained in building
  industrial-strength logging systems going back as far as 1999.
  </p>

  <p>LOGBack's basic architecture is sufficiently generic so as to
  apply under different circumstances. At present time, LOGBack is
  divided into three modules, Core, Classic and Access.
  </p>

  <p>The Core module lays the groundwork for the other two
  modules. The Classic module can be assimilated to an improved
  version of log4j. The Access module integrates with Servlet
  containers to provide HTPP-access log functionality. Note that you
  can easily build your own modules on top of the Core module.
