<p>The ch.qos.logback.core.db package provides bases classes to append objects 
into various databases.
</p>

<p>Most popular database systems, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, DB2 and MsSQL
are supported.
</p>

<p>Just as importantly, the way for obtaining JDBC connections is pluggable. Connections can
be obtained through the traditional way of DriverManager, or alternatively as a DataSource.
A DataSource can be instantiated directly or it can obtained through JNDI.
